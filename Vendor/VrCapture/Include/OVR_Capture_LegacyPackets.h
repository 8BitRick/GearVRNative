Content     :   Oculus performance capture protocol description.
Created     :   January, 2015
Notes       :   This file contains previous versions of packet structs, which is indended
                for tools to use via some template foo to parse old binary streams.

                The idea being anytime an existing packet struct needs to change, you copy
                it into here first and create a specialization of that old version.

                Then at the beginning of the network stream the host sends version information
                about every packet struct and their sizes, and the client builds a function pointer
                table for each packet type based on the version provided. And if no function
                is found it falls back to a default implementation that just skips it.
