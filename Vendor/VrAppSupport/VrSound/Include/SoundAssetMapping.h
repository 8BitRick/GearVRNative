Description :

SoundAssetMapping is a simple sound asset management class which allows sound assets to be easily replaced without recompilation. 
SoundAssetMapping is driven by a JSON file in which sounds are mapped as key-value pairs, where a value is the actual path to the wav file. 

For example:

	"sv_touch_active" : "sv_touch_active.wav"

These are defined in a json file: sound_assets.json.
Typically, we first load "res/raw/sound_assets.json" which references the wav files within that folder in VRLib.
In addition, we also load an app specific definition file in the app: "assets/sound_assets.json". 
The app file may define app specific sounds placed next to it in the assets folder. Additionally, it may
also be used to override the VRLib sounds by either redefining the sound as an empty string to remove the sound or
define it to point at a new sound file - without the need to modify the code that actually plays the sound.

For development, SoundAssetMapping checks for a sound_assets.json within the Oculus folder either on the internal or external
sdcard. If this file is found, it is solely used to load sounds.
