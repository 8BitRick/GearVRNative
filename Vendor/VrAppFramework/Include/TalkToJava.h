/*
 * Any call to java from the VR thread is a potential hitch.  Some, like
 * SurfaceTexture update calls are unavoidable, as they must be done on
 * the thread with a GL context, but most others should be run in a separate
 * thread, which is facilitated by this class.
 *
 * Hitches are less of an issue now with async TimeWarp, but very long pauses
 * would still cause animation freezes and black edge pull in, even though
 * TimeWarp is still head tracking. Making Java calls from a SCHED_FIFO
 * thread is probably also inadvisable.
